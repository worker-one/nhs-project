# Research Design, Implementation, and Results

## Objective

Using the database schema, develop, implement, and analyse three distinct modelling solutions (15 marks each) to address the Data Intelligence teamâ€™s aim (as described
in the scenario). The three solutions must collectively cover all three of the following categories:

1) inferential statistics

2) supervised learning

3) unsupervised learning,

with each solution primarily focusing on one or a combination of these categories. The solutions should be of sufficient complexity to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the data and the problem.

For each solution, include:

- Problem: Clearly and concisely state the specific problem within the NHS context that
your solution addresses.

- Solution: Detail the design of your solution, including the specific techniques used and how they are combined. Ensure that your design incorporates information from multiple
tables in the database where relevant.

- Justification: Explain why the selected inferential statistics, supervised learning
algorithms, and/or unsupervised learning algorithms are appropriate for the specific
problem being addressed.

- Implementation: Provide well-commented and organised code (including SQL queries)
used to implement your solution. Clearly indicate and justify any modifications made to the database schema or data. Ensure that your code is reproducible.

- Results: Present your findings in a clear and concise manner, using appropriate
visualisations (charts, graphs, tables) as appropriate. Critically analyse your results,
discussing how they can help the NHS address the stated problem.

- Limitations: Discuss any limitations of your solution, including potential biases in the data, assumptions made, or areas where the solution could be improved.
