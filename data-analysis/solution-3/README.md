## Modelling Solution 3: Patient Segmentation and Healthcare Service Optimization

**Category:** Unsupervised Learning

#### Problem
The NHS needs to identify distinct patient groups with similar healthcare needs and utilization patterns to optimize service delivery, resource planning, and personalized care strategies without relying on predefined categories.

#### Solution
Implement a comprehensive clustering and pattern discovery framework using:
- K-means clustering for patient segmentation based on demographics and service utilization
- Hierarchical clustering to understand patient group relationships
- DBSCAN for identifying outlier patients with unusual healthcare patterns
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Association rule mining for medication and treatment pattern discovery
- Network analysis of patient-provider relationships

#### Justification
- K-means effectively segments patients into actionable groups
- Hierarchical clustering reveals natural patient group hierarchies
- DBSCAN identifies rare but important patient cases
- PCA handles high-dimensional healthcare data effectively
- Association rules discover hidden patterns in treatment combinations

#### Implementation Technologies
- Python with scikit-learn, scipy
- SQL queries aggregating data from Patients, Appointments, Prescriptions, Tests, ServiceBillings
- NetworkX for relationship analysis
- t-SNE/UMAP for visualization of patient clusters
- Apriori algorithm (mlxtend) for association rule mining

#### Expected Results
- 5-7 distinct patient segments with clear characteristics
- Unusual patient cases requiring special attention
- Medication and treatment association patterns
- Network maps of patient-provider relationships

#### Limitations
- Cluster interpretation requires domain expertise
- Results may be sensitive to feature scaling and selection
- Number of clusters needs careful validation
- Temporal patterns may not be fully captured
- May miss rare but clinically important patient subtypes

### Results

We show our results in the report file `report.html`. Here are main findings:

#### Segmentation

Our analysis successfully identified **4 distinct patient clusters** from 25,000 patients using 17 key features:

Cluster distribution:
- **Cluster 0** (Primary Care Patients): 23,777 patients (95.1%) – representing the majority population with standard healthcare utilization patterns
- **Cluster 1** (High-Intensity Care): 644 patients (2.6%) – patients with intensive healthcare needs requiring specialized attention
- **Cluster 2** (Moderate Care): 396 patients (1.6%) – patients with moderate healthcare utilization above average
- **Cluster 3** (Specialized Care): 183 patients (0.7%) – patients with specific specialized healthcare requirements

The clustering was optimized using PCA dimensionality reduction (21 → 10 components) and validated through silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.

#### Unusual patient cases

DBSCAN analysis identified **566 outlier patients** (2.8%) with unusual healthcare patterns that don't fit into standard clusters. These patients may require:
- Personalized care plans
- Special resource allocation
- Investigation for rare conditions or complex comorbidities
- Enhanced monitoring and follow-up protocols

#### Medication and treatment association patterns

Association rule mining analysis found limited frequent medication patterns with current thresholds, suggesting:
- Highly individualized medication patterns across the patient population
- Need for adjusted minimum support thresholds for pattern discovery
- Potential for specialized analysis within specific patient clusters
- Opportunity for targeted medication optimization studies

#### Network maps of patient-provider relationships

Network analysis revealed a complex healthcare ecosystem with:
- **427,752 network nodes** representing patients and healthcare professionals
- **554,387 connections** showing patient-provider relationships
- Centrality analysis identifying key healthcare professionals with high patient loads. For example, Ms Sheila Simpson, Dermatologist, has the highest centrality level of 0.000690.
- Network structure insights for optimizing referral patterns and resource distribution
