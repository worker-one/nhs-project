    "\n",
    "**Category:** Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "The NHS needs to understand the statistical relationships between patient demographics, treatment patterns, and health outcomes to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care quality. Specifically, we need to determine if there are significant differences in treatment outcomes across different hospitals, departments, and patient demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are trying to develop a comprehensive statistical analysis framework using:\n",
    "- ANOVA tests to compare treatment outcomes across hospitals and departments\n",
    "- Chi-square tests for categorical relationships (e.g., gender vs. treatment success)\n",
    "- Multiple regression analysis to identify factors affecting treatment costs and duration\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing for appointment wait times vs. patient satisfaction\n",
    "- Confidence interval estimation for key performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Justification\n",
    "Proposed methods are well-established in the statistical science. They handle the complex, multi-table nature of healthcare data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ANOVA is appropriate for comparing means across multiple groups (hospitals/departments)\n",
    "- Regression analysis can identify key predictors of healthcare costs and outcomes\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing provides evidence-based insights for policy decisions\n",

    "- SQL queries joining Patients, Appointments, Surgeries, Tests, ServiceBillings, Hospitals, Departments\n",

    "- Key demographic factors affecting treatment costs\n",
    "- Evidence-based recommendations for resource allocation\n",
    "- Performance benchmarks with confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "As any other method, the proposed method has its limitations.\n",
    "- We have to assumes normal distribution for parametric tests\n",

    "- May require data transformation for non-normal distributions\n",
